The TLG repository contains ARM templates used to deploy Test Lab Guide (TLG) environments. TLGs help you quickly learn about Microsoft products. They're great for situations where you need to evaluate a technology or configuration before you decide whether it's right for you or before you roll it out to users. The "I built it out myself and it works" hands-on experience helps you understand the deployment requirements of a new product or solution so you can better plan for hosting it in production. You can learn more about TLGs [here](http://aka.ms/catlgs).
